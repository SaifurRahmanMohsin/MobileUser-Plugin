Mobile front-end user management for October CMS.

This repository serves as an issue tracker for the [Mobile User Plugin](https://octobercms.com/plugin/mohsin-user). Any feature requests, suggestions, improvements can be made [here](https://github.com/SaifurRahmanMohsin/MobileUser-Plugin/issues).

** IMPORTANT! — Make sure you have purchased the [Mohsin.Mobile](http://octobercms.com/plugin/mohsin-mobile) plugin before getting this. **

This plugin is similar to the RainLab.User plugin except it’s built to work mainly with mobile front-ends. It exposes RESTful API nodes that enable interaction with the backend thereby allowing users to sign up and login as front-end users.
